Reporting a Vulnerability
=========================

**Do not open GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities as they are public!**

Please report security vulnerabilities to security@pengutronix.de.
We will work with the reporter to create a fix and to coordinate the disclosure.

Scope
-----

This policy applies to **meta-rauc** (recipes, classes, patches).
Issues in RAUC itself or third-party sources may be handled upstream.

Supported Versions
------------------

Security fixes are generally provided for the current `master` branch
and maintained stable branches, if available.
